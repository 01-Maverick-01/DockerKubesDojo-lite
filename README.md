# Docker and Kubernetes Dojo
Tutorial on Using Docker and Kubernetes

**Big thanks to Michael Frayer for most of the content of this tutorial is from him!** 


## Pre-requisites:

Generally speaking you need to have the Git client and Docker along with Kubernetes installed locally.

#### A console or shell environment

Some basic skills working with command line tooling are required to complete this tutorial as you will interact with the CLI often throughout.  Windows Command prompt or Powershell is recommended for Window's users.  MacOS and Linux users can use their shell of choice.  It will be called out where there is a difference in CLI statements for Windows vs MacOS/Linux users.


#### Git
If you don't already have a Git Client, you can download the Git tools from here:
 - https://git-scm.com/downloads
